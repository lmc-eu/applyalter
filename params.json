Unlike some more radical approaches, applyalter is designed for database-first design and fully supports data changes and migrations (ie not just DDL, but also DML).\r\n\r\nMain advantages over \".sql\" scripts are:\r\n* execute single file, zip archive or whole directory\r\n* commands are executed in transaction (by default)\r\n* in-build checks to skip creating already existing entities (tables, columns etc.)\r\n* custom checks to skip changing already changed data\r\n* each executed alterscript is logged to log table (with execution time, duration and checksum)\r\n* fine-grained error control - by default every error is fatal, but some of them can be ignored for specific commands\r\n* support for characters in any encoding (as long as it's well-formed XML)\r\n* dry-run mode\r\n* database identification in script metadata\r\n* attached files (BLOB, CLOB or CSV parsed into columns)\r\n* environment-only scripts\r\n* special support for large-scale data changes that cannot fit into single transaction\r\n* not tied to one specific database (used on db2, postgresql and oracle)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
